# Project Introduction

The main objective of this project is to analyze Survey on Mental Health in the Tech Workplace in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. 
</p><br>Dataset Information:

This data is from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) using survey data from years 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Each survey measures and attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

</p><br>Requirements:

- Load the data using SQLite and Pandas.
- Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, checking for correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements.
- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.
- Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
 

</p><br>Objectives:

- Practice working with SQLite datasets.
- Practice performing EDA.
- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using SQL and Pandas.

**Summary**:

The analysis of mental health survey data reveals several key trends and insights:

1. Survey Participation Trends:
   - The number of respondents increased from 2014 to 2016 but declined in subsequent years.
   - Most respondents are in the younger age groups, particularly in their 20s and 30s.

2. Average Age Shift:
   - The average age of respondents shifted to the 30s group over the years.
   - There is a general upward trend in the average age of respondents.

3. Treatment Seeking Behavior:
   - Individuals in younger age groups (17-27) are less inclined to seek treatment for mental health disorders.
   - The propensity to seek treatment notably increases among individuals aged 28 and older.
   - There is a growing interest in seeking treatment for mental health disorders over the years.

4. Gender Distribution:
   - The survey is predominantly composed of male respondents.

5. Willingness to Discuss Mental Health:
   - There is a similar willingness among both males and females to discuss mental health.
   - Employees are more inclined to discuss physical health rather than mental health with their coworkers.

6. Geographical Insights:
   - A majority of respondents are based in the United States.
   - Michigan, New York, and Illinois stand out as frontrunners in providing mental health support.

7. Correlations:
   - There is a strong link between past mental health disorders and current conditions.
   - Family mental health history shows a strong correlation with past/present disorders.
   - Seeking treatment correlates strongly with past and present mental health issues.

8. Work Environment Impact:
   - Individuals who work remotely experience a lesser impact on their work due to mental health conditions.

9. Company Size and Mental Health Benefits:
   - Larger companies offer a higher incidence of mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage compared to smaller companies.

10. Tech/IT Roles and Mental Health Discussions:
    - Individuals in tech/IT roles are more at ease discussing mental health issues with their coworkers.

**Suggestions:**

1. Targeted Outreach:
   - Develop targeted outreach efforts to encourage participation from a diverse age group to ensure a more representative sample.

2. Age-Specific Interventions:
   - Tailor mental health interventions to address the unique needs of different age groups, particularly focusing on younger individuals.

3. Awareness Campaigns:
   - Implement awareness campaigns to destigmatize mental health discussions, especially among male respondents.

4. Geographical Support:
   - Consider implementing mental health support initiatives in states with lower average support levels, aiming to bridge the gap.

5. Remote Work Support:
   - Continue supporting remote work, acknowledging its positive impact on mental health conditions.

6. Company Size Considerations:
   - Provide insights to smaller companies on the benefits of including mental health coverage in their healthcare plans.

7. Tech Industry Initiatives:
   - Encourage other industries to adopt practices from the tech industry that prioritize mental health support.

8. Holistic Health Approach:
   - Advocate for a holistic approach to health discussions in workplaces, emphasizing both physical and mental well-being.
